THWebViewController - Tiny implementation of WebViewController
==============================================================

![Snapshot](https://github.com/tokuhirom/THWebViewController/raw/master/snapshot.png)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a tiny library for iOS(iPhone/iPad).
This library only provides one class named THWebViewController.
So it's same as TTWebViewController and NIWebViewController.
Yes, THWebViewController is forked from NIWebViewController.

You can drop in 1 header, 1 code, 1 bundles, that's all.
Very easy.

I don't like large application frameworks for iOS application.
Since I'm minimalist.

SYNOPSIS
--------

    THWebViewController * webController = [[THWebViewController alloc] init];
    [webController openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://tou.ch/"]];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:webController
                                         animated:YES];
